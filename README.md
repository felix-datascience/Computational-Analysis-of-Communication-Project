# Computational Analysis of Communication Project

This repository contains out approach to the analysis of communication project. We tested out two different ways of labeling the YouTube comments in the same manner as we did manually in the course.

- First, we used GPT-3 via the OpenAI API with zero-shot prompting (**1_openai_model**).
- In a second, more scalable approach, we applied few-shot learning with SetFit to label our data (**2_setfit_model**).
- We then used the generated labels in a subsequent analysis where we put the results into context with computational communication science and parasocial interactions (**3_analysis**).
